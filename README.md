# Pixel Art Maker Project

Final Project for the Google Front end scholarship challenge

## Instructions

Your users should be able to:

*Dynamically set the size of the table as an N by M grid.
*Choose a color.
*Click a cell in the grid to fill that cell with the chosen color.

Your primary task is to implement the makeGrid() function, that dynamically creates a grid that the user can interact with.
